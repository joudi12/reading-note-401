## Django
### Django is a Web framework written in Python. A Web framework is a software that supports the development of dynamic Web sites, applications, and services. It provides a set of tools and functionalities that solves many common problems associated with Web development, such as security features, database access, sessions, template processing, URL routing, internationalization, localization, and much more.

###  Django provides multiple protections against:

1. Clickjacking
2. Cross-site scripting
3. Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
4. SQL injection
5. Remote code execution

## The Structure of a Django Website
### When you create a Django project, the Django framework itself creates a root directory of the project with the project name on it. That contains some files and folder, which provide the very basic functionality to your website and on that strong foundation you will be building your full scaled website.
### Each application also has its own URLs as well as its own HTML templates and static files, such as JavaScript and CSS.

### Django apps supports the Model-View-Controller Pattern, which is the architecture on which most web frameworks are built, where the basic principle is that in each application there are three separate files that handle the three main pieces of logic separately:

- Model defines the data structure. This is usually a database and is the base layer to an application.
- View displays some or all of the data to the user with HTML and CSS.
- Controller handles how the database and the view interact.
##  Django code 

### In a traditional data-driven website, a web application waits for HTTP requests from the web browser (or other client). When a request is received the application works out what is needed based on the URL and possibly information in POST data or GET data. Depending on what is required it may then read or write information from a database or perform other tasks required to satisfy the request. The application will then return a response to the web browser, often dynamically creating an HTML page for the browser to display by inserting the retrieved data into placeholders in an HTML template.

## How Django Works Behind the Scenes
### Django is a Python-based web framework used by millions of developers and billions of consumers through popular apps like Instagram. It is open source, meaning the code is available for free on Github and can be downloaded onto any developer’s computer and used alongside the official documentation.
### Django’s code is open source and available to all. Django’s organization is managed by a non-profit, the DSF, with a miniscule budget. And Django code is lead by a core team of volunteers, two paid Django Fellows, and a larger group of contributors.
### One of the best ways to become more involved in Django is to attend an annual conference and meet all the contributors in person. Currently there are DjangoCons in the US, Europe, Australia, and Africa in 2020 for the first time
